Keep in Touch automates keeping in touch for you.

Registering through Facebook gives the Keep in Touch permissions for one's friends list, automatically importing friends as contacts. 

On the user's profile, each contact card shows their scheduled messages (past events appear faded). Upcoming scheduled events appear at the top, at the Queued Messages section.

Users can schedule messages for each contact, given their email and U.S. phone number. Messages can be customized or selected from a list of general-purpose messages (scraped from the web using Scrapy). Clicking the option for type of message returns a random message in the new message text area.

A separate schedule app threaded to the server queries the database for any messages to be sent out that day. Keep in Touch will send out messages to contacts when the day comes via email and text to contacts on the user's behalf (using the SendGrid and Twilio APIs respectively).

Keep in Touch will also send users a reminder email and text of upcoming events. By responding to reminder texts, users can update/edit messages directly updating the database given a unique event_id number at the end. The Twilio API is configured using ngrok to tunnel traffic to the local host.
